Federated averaging learning based on TensorFlow Federated



1. Follow (https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/install) to install TensorFlow Federated using pip. It succeeds when you see "Hello World!"

2. Run the sentences in "requirements.txt" under your virtual environment created from the first step. (Can't install the txt file at one time for now, so have to run sentences manually)

3. Use "preprocessImage.py" and “gen_g5.py” to create h5 files.

4. Adjust the hyper-parameters and path in "main.py". Run it to train the model.
